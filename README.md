# Churn Forecasting Engine for B2B Seed Sales Networks
A business-focused machine learning solution that predicts dealer churn in B2B seed sales, enabling early intervention and reducing revenue loss across regional markets.
---

## Problem Statement

In the B2B agri-input sector, dealer churn leads to loss of recurring revenue, disrupted supply chains, and poor market coverage.  
The goal of this project was to build a **churn prediction engine** that enables the sales team to **detect and retain high-risk dealers early**, using past transactional behavior.

## Project Summary

This project addressed a real-world business challenge: **dealer churn prediction** in a competitive and seasonal seed sales market.  
Using transactional data from 58,000+ dealers, I developed and fine-tuned machine learning models to identify early churn patterns.  
The final model — a tuned **Random Forest classifier** — achieved **99.49% accuracy**, delivering high precision and recall on the churn class.  
This solution empowers the business to take **targeted action on at-risk dealers**, protect revenue, and improve long-term engagement.  
It converts raw data into strategic insights that directly support smarter decision-making in the field.
